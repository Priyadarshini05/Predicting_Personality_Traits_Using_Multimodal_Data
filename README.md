# Predicting_Personality_Traits_Using_Multimodal_Data
1. Developed Random Forest, SVM, KNN and XGBoost machine learning models to predict
personality from multi-modal data.
2. Used BioSPPy toolbox and SciPy library to extract features from physiological signals and
OpenFace toolbox to extract gaze features from HD videos.
3. Worked on dimensionality reduction and feature selection algorithms to improve model prediction.
